Valid triangle Number

Given an integer array nums, return the number of triplets chosen from the array that can make triangles if we take them as side lengths of a triangle.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,3,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: Valid combinations are: 
2,3,4 (using the first 2)
2,3,4 (using the second 2)
2,2,3
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,2,3,4]
Output: 4

Hint : 
For three sides (a, b, c) (where a ≤ b ≤ c) to form a triangle, the condition is:
a + b > c
So the problem reduces to: for each largest side c, 
count how many pairs (a, b) satisfy a + b > c.
